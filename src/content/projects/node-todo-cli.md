# Todo Node CLI Project

This project was a fairly quick and simple, one day shindig that was both informative and useful. I wanted a list app in my terminal to keep track of things that I do while using WSL/Ubuntu/Kali Linux and am all caught up in the command line. I also have ADHD so it's important for me to keep organized with lists.

## Planning the Project

I didn't really do a whole lot of planning - just fired up the project, added some dependencies I'd used before in other CLI apps and learned about. Added MongoDB and it was ready to go!
