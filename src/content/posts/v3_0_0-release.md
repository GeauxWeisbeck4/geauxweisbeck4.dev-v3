Today is the big day! I finally have the official v3.0.0 release out and you can view it on [the GitHub repository page here](https://github.com/geauxweisbeck4/geauxweisbeck4.dev-v3). It's not anything to crazy, but it does contain the release notes. You obviously know the site is live because you are reading this blog post right now!

## Upcoming: v3.0.1

So the next version will be a minor update release. This will be a lot of aesthetic things that you will notice if you pay close attention to the UI. There will be some new components, etc. but stuff you wouldn't care about unless you are a developer yourself. 

I didn't really get this site polished how I would have liked to before releasing v3.0.0, but it was necessary for me to get it up and out on the web to start getting feedback and working in public since it is my digital garden after all... I hope you enjoy it!
