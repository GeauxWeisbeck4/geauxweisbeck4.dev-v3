HuskerJS.dev (version 2) is a project I'm bringing back to life as a community for developers, data science people, and any other hardcore fan to collaborate on open source sports projects, especially CFB, and also a way for me to create content for one of my favorite hobbies.

## HuskerJS.dev (version 1)

Initially, HuskerJS.dev was going to be a decentralized college sport blogging platform, but it pretty much just ended up kind of being a Husker football blog. And it kinda stopped being that when Scott Frost got fired and Nebraska pretty much proved it was awful. You can visit the [first version of the website here](https://huskerjs.netlify.app).

## HuskerJS.dev (version 2)

This version of HuskerJS.dev is going to be quite a bit different. I've been working on a newsletter, a new website, and planning a project to kick off with right away here in the next week or two. I'm excited to tell y'all more as it happens! Stay tuned!
