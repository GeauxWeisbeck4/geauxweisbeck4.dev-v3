As I continue to dig deeper into data structures and algorithms, I would like to recap a bit about what I learned today while reading "Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript" by Federico Kereki.

## Designing Algorithms

This chapter talks about the various problem solving methods that you can use to design your own algorithms. This post is a work in progress, but I will briefly recap the methods discussed in the book.
