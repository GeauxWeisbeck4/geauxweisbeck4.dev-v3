# Tar Heel Dev Studio

This is the third version of [Tar Heel Dev Studio's website](https://tarheeldevstudio.com). It was important for me to make sure the site accurately reflected my values, current skills, and most up to date experience.

This site was more carefully designed and developed, because I'm a better developer, but also because I have wanted to put more time and effort into focusing on this brand, rather than just doing freelancing under a personal or no brand.

## Tech Stack

- [Astro.js](https://astro.build)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- HTML & CSS

## Astro Integrations Used
